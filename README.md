# AngularFrontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.3.

This Project contains 3 components
1- product list
2- create product
3- exception handler

As in case JWT Authentication failed we can use exception handler as landing page other wise show data


NOTE: localhost:4200/ is my authentication page
for list : localhost:4200/products
for create: localhost:4200/create-product

For now only 1 user is accessible as no requirement mentioned regarding multiple users 

and password which needs to be stored in DB is 
   userName : raza
   password : 1234

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
